### TODO

- [ ] Add support of localization. Research how `language_code` is handled in Bot API.
- [ ] Add support of [making request in response to webhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#making-requests-when-getting-updates).

### Findings

- Bots cannot have Premium ([see](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api/issues/745#issuecomment-2925418425)).
